<div class="about" id="About" style="height:900px">
	<p>I am an aspiring Software Developer, who is willing to learn more about the Computer Science industry. I am currently learning towards a National Diploma in Information Technology, Software Development at Tshwane University of Technology. In addition to what was already mentioned, I can describe myself as an initiative-taking individual with passion for developing software. My passion goes far more beyond working during office hours. I understand very well that a career in Tech is more about continous learning and is being willing to sacrifice my time to encourage my growth in the Tech world.</p>

	<p>I now am able to use languges like c++, and java and can work with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, as well as some Javascript. Currently I am learning how to use libraries such as Codeigniter, Laravel as well as react js. I am also learning how to use the MVC framework, C#, and how to use APIs.</p>

    <p>In the future, I would like to know how to use Angular, Rasor Views, Entity Framework, and many more. I also would like to be able to be an Android and IOS Developer. I am Kgotso and that is my story, Thanks! </p>
